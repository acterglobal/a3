- Overall on the entire subspace / related chats section; "Room not found"-issue should be gone now
- Chats and Spaces created with a parent are now set up to be seen and accessible by their parent (by default)
- Canonical Parent is shown everywhere (it makes sense): sidebar, chat listing, etc
- Joining subspaces with public or restricted mode now possible
