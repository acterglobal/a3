** Changes since nightly-latest **
- Reworked the API to create TaskLists and Tasks

- As an admin of a space you are now able to redact any space item as well (e.g. Pin, Event) not only as the author.

- As a space admin you can now link subspace and space chats right from the empty screen

- You can now bookmark spaces, too. If you have bookmarked spaces they will show on your home screen rather than the full list.

- You can now configure the rules to join a space or chat room, including making it public and limiting it to a set of spaces, whose members can join directly.
- Indicator in the Space header shows who can access that space

- Next to sharing an Attachment & iCal you can now download them, if your device supports that.
