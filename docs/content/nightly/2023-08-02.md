  The Activities section now shows you all the notifications
- **New Labs Feature: Notifications** (Linux, iOS & Android)
  There is a new (default-off) feature available in labs to show desktop/app
  notifications whenever a new notifications comes in. The data shown currently
  very bare-bones and it only works when the App is running. On Desktop only
  Linux is supported at the moment.
