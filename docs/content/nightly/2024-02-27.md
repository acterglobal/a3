** Changes since nightly-latest **
- [fix] show the proper avatar for chats of spaces loaded from remote
- [fix] load the proper avatar for spaces in the space selector (most notably within the updates creation flow)
- [fix] only show the "empty" screen when there are indeed no chats for the space to show
