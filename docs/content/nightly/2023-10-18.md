- fixes the swipe reply bug on chat messages where right swipe wasn't working before.

- Calendar Events
  - fix bug where end date shows same as start date when event is created.
  - Remove pending status button from event rsvp selection. Events would still show their status as pending if not selected (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Merge the start/end time and date textfields from create/edit event sheets. Now the date and time textfields will show ranged date and time after selection.
  - Remove unused link input textfields from create/edit event sheets.
