** Changes since nightly-latest **
- You can now bookmark chat rooms (via the chat room details page)
- An easier way to search & filter chats: just pull down in the chat rooms list and the filter bar appears. Next to a cleaned up chat search it also features quick-toggles for bookmarked chats and DMs only. The selection made here will be persisted between app restart for convenience;

- [fix] Do not block the app just because the server sync deserialization failed.
- Upon initial sync and sync errors show the current state in the Activities tab
- Implement back-off retry (with a max of 5min wait-time) for sync upon server failure
