- Fix: Avatars some time showed up weird, were broken or didn't show at all
- Fix: Several instances in which the App failed or froze because of broken Avatars


[Improvement] : Now you can view space and group chat avatar in full screen
[Improvement] : If you have permission than you can have inline avatar change option instead of go to any detail screen
[New] : You can zoom in and out avatar view for better visualisation
