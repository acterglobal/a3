** Changes since nightly-latest **
- The search of the public directory has been completely rewritten with an improved UI, better interactive items and cleaner overall flow. Several other publicly known servers have been allowing you to easily select and search them without having to know the exact address, and you can search spaces and chat rooms within the same widget now.
- You can now add any room uri in the quick jump as well and directly join from there
- When what you are looking for is not found in the quick jump, searching the public directory for that term is offered right away, making it easier to find existing rooms
- Support for parsing `matrix://`-URI has been added to the public search and quick jump search

- The app is now available in Polish. It will be autoselected if this is your system language and you didn't pick any language via the settings before. You can change your preferred language in your Profile settings.
