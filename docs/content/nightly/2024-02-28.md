** Changes since nightly-latest **
- [new] : You can now include links to Events right into the Updates sent to your space members. Allowing them to easily get access and respond to any upcoming Events right from the Updates screen.
- [fix] Redactions are now applied live when they are received. No more dangeling old objects (e.g. Updates, Events, Pins) in your spaces until a proper relogin but dealing with them on the fly.
