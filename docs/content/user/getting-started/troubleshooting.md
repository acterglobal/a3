## It asks me for a (registration) token...?!?

We are currently running Acter in a private beta. If you do not yet have any [Matrix](https://matrix.org) account on any other server, you can register one with our server `acter.global`. That however is currently limited to invited organizations. Whoever asked you to join should have received a specific token for your organization, please ask them for the token. We will lift this requirement as soon as we reach a public beta status.
