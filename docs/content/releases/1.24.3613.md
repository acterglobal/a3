# Changes since v1.24.3530 
- Notifications were not always properly activated upon first registration, this is now fixed. You might be prompted to allow notifications (once) upon a fresh start of the app if you had run into this problem before (without knowing).

- Improved layout of selected emoji reactions in chat: takes up less space, should be easier to grasp on a quick view.

- Reworked the API to create TaskLists and Tasks

- As an admin of a space you are now able to redact any space item as well (e.g. Pin, Event) not only as the author.

- As a space admin you can now link subspace and space chats right from the empty screen

- You can now bookmark spaces, too. If you have bookmarked spaces they will show on your home screen rather than the full list.

- [fix] do not send typing notifications if the user disabled that in the settings
- [fix] only one room could be receiving typing state at a time despite multiple rooms actually being in that state.

- You can now configure the rules to join a space or chat room, including making it public and limiting it to a set of spaces, whose members can join directly.
- Indicator in the Space header shows who can access that space

- Next to sharing an Attachment & iCal you can now download them, if your device supports that.
