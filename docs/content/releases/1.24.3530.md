# Changes since release-latest 
- Notifications were not always properly activated upon first registration, this is now fixed. You might be prompted to allow notifications (once) upon a fresh start of the app if you had run into this problem before (without knowing).

- Improved layout of selected emoji reactions in chat: takes up less space, should be easier to grasp on a quick view.

- [fix] do not send typing notifications if the user disabled that in the settings
- [fix] only one room could be receiving typing state at a time despite multiple rooms actually being in that state.
