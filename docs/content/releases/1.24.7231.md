- Missing a subspace or subchat? You can now click the refresh button on the sub screens and we will fetch teh latest version from the server.


[bugfix] : Fix bug that force logout doesn't work in session card (issue#1239)

- You can now use the cool share feature right from the super-invites list in your settings

- Admins can now suggest other spaces & chats from a space. These are then shown to a user when they enter the spaces for the first time with a convenient function to quickly join them or subset of them

- Chat mentions are much more optimized and efficient in bringing up users even on large rooms.
- Swipe-to-reply/edit feature is now disabled on deleted/encrypted messages as intended with chat message actions.

- Create a default sub-chat with just the toggle of a button at Space creation

- [Improvement] : Better inline edit features for space topic, description and avatar without going through edit space screen
