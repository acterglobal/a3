# Changes since release-latest 
- [new] : You can now include links to Events right into the Updates sent to your space members. Allowing them to easily get access and respond to any upcoming Events right from the Updates screen.
- [fix] Redactions are now applied live when they are received. No more dangeling old objects (e.g. Updates, Events, Pins) in your spaces until a proper relogin but dealing with them on the fly.

- You will now receive a push notification to your mobile device for Updates pushed to spaces you follow. On supported devices it even shows the content including the image of the update in the notification. You can disable receiving those in your push notification settings.
- We've enhanced the render of push notifications for DMs and chat messages including the chat name and user avatar (on supported devices).

- Pins:
  - Includes various improvements on spacing, padding on pin item card .i.e. pins overview and space pins overview.
  - Pin item card in pins overview and space pins overview will show pin content description.

- [fix] show the proper avatar for chats of spaces loaded from remote
- [fix] load the proper avatar for spaces in the space selector (most notably within the updates creation flow)
- [fix] only show the "empty" screen when there are indeed no chats for the space to show
