# Matrix SDK Store Media Cache Wrapper

## Deprecated

Since [the merge #3858 of into `main`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3858) splitting the media cache features off into its own trait, there is no need to wrap the matrix-sdk store anymore to do so. Thus this crate is no longer needed and wonâ€™t be maintained.
