# Changes since release-latest 
- [feat.]: More interactivity comes with Attachments, now image and video attachments are enabled to be viewed in full screen while other files can be shared natively.
- [fix]: Attachments selection is also now shown on the desktop, allowing you to choose specific file types for upload.

- [feat.] Chat now shows typing notifications to inform you who's been typing. This setting is enabled by default but can be turned off in App Settings -> Chat Settings.

- Several smaller fixes around the Chat input: it's now properly resetting the edit/reply-to message, marks the right message for editing (your own), shows the editable content and has better icons for the different swipe-actions

- You can now share any Event as an iCalendar item with the outside world.
