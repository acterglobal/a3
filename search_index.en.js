This section contains information for space administrator, moderators as well as system administrators and technical and security consultants to dig deeper into acter and understand its underlying system.\nIntroduction to Matrix\nActer is built upon the publicly spec'ed decentralized Matrix instant messaging protocol. It's a http(s)-based REST protocol exchanging JSON between federated servers, and servers and clients. The Acter App is a client for that protocol.\nThis is a federated protocol similar to email, including that users are bound to a server that is identified via DNS and embedded in the username. E.g. @sari:acter.global is the account of sari on the acter.global server.\nUnderstanding spaces, chats &amp; rooms\nNext to users and their profiles the most important entity in matrix are rooms. Almost everything happens within the context of some room: sending chat messages, configuring hierarchy, sharing files and state machines. Consider a room the base entity of shared permissions and access of a (changing) set of users.\nRooms can be configured to be of various types. By default a room is considered a chat room for instant messaging (called a \"chat\" in acter context). By setting the is_dm-flag, it can be marked as being a direct message between a small set of people. Next to that the matrix spec knows of spaces, which are generally understood to be hierarchical rooms referencing other rooms and allowing for permission sharing.\nActer spaces are a MSC3008 configured subtype with the global.acter.team-purpose. Any space can be set to become an acter space by setting its purpose to that and the Acter app will recognize it properly.\nNaming things: As all entities - chat rooms, DMs and spaces - are the same room entity underneath, this admin section of the docs will primarily use the term \"room\" and only use space or \"acter space\" if it is about specific things only applicable to that area and not rooms in general.\nSpace hierarchy\nSpaces introduced hierarchical organization in the matrix protocol in a bi-directional pattern. Meaning that any space or room can configure any number of space.parent and space.child references in their own state pointing in either direction. This allows for a highly flexible reference and space association system. To clarify that a bit, we are using the following terms depending on the bi-directional states:\n\nSpace or Room A has a space.parent reference to a space B with a space.child referencing Room A: Room A consider Space B its parent.\n(Allowing to have more than one associated parent allows us to have \"joint venture\"-spaces and rooms that cross the boundaries of any number of organizations)\nSpace X has a space.child reference to a space Y that has a space.parent referencing Space X: Space X considers the space Y a \"subspace\"\nSpace P has a space.child reference to a room Q that has a space.parent referencing Space P: Space P considers room Q a (space) \"chat\" (and is listed underneath it)\nSpace M has a space.child reference to space K without knowing whether that has any relation to it (because it might be hidden to it or there is no references on it): Space M consider K a \"recommended space\" -- this is useful to show other spaces or organizations on your space to recommend to the viewer.\n\nSpace hierarchy permissions\nThrough this hierarchy room join permissions can also be configured to be in relation to these spaces. E.g. you can configure a room to allow anyone from its parent spaces to join.\nLearn more\n\nMatrix Specification Process\nMatrix User Identifies\n\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/admin/space-admin/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"https://dev.acter.global/admin/space-admin/moderation/":{"body":"Power Levels\nPermissions within any room (so a single chat or space) is configured through so called PowerLevels in matrix. A power level is a number, everyone in the room configured with a number higher or equal to the number is allowed to perform the action, everyone below is not. Canonically (if only values 0-100 are used) a user with the power level of 100 is called an \"Administrator\", 50 is equal to a \"Moderator\", 0 is a regular user.\nThe creator of a room (or both for a DM) is given power level 100 by default. Admins can configure the power level of each user, as well as change which power levels are required per specific action or feature as well as the default fallback for every user not assigned a specific power level.\nRoom Moderation Actions\nRedact a message\nDefault Power Level requirement: 50 (Moderator)\nIf any user code is offensive or otherwise against the terms of service or code of conduct of the associated space a moderator may redact that message. This removes the user-generated content from the message, including any copies on the server. Some specific metadata is kept for technical reasons however.\nKick a user\nDefault Power Level requirement: 50 (Moderator)\nIf a user is spamming the room or otherwise doesn't adhere to the code of conduct or terms of service of the space, any moderator can kick the user (with a lower power level) from the space. This removes them from the space with a publicly stated message, and they have to rejoin actively before they can continue. Thus it is considered a pretty harsh warning and should usually not come out of the blue but only be issued after a warning has been stated before.\nBan a user\nDefault Power Level requirement: 50 (Moderator)\nIf you want to permanently block a user from even rejoining the space, a user can additionally be banned from the space/room.

Instead Acter builds upon the activity-stream nature of the matrix protocol by applying these events to a state machine upon models. Within this concept, an event may create a new Model or be applied to an existing model or both. Like task-event, which may create the task itself, but also alters the task-list it belongs to, or a comment event creating a comment related to a different object. Similarly, there are pure update events, which do not create models themselves but only transition the state of an existing model - like the TaskUpdate event for example.\nLinear timeline\nFor this system to work, updates must be applied in a linear fashion. Thus, when the application re-connects and finds new messages have been posted since it went offline, it must fetch these events from the last point it had until now and apply them in the order they have been sent.\nPermissive data merging\nAs the system is not CRDT conform, the order of events could matter. However, most \"transitions\" are pretty permissive in their nature, meaning that from a higher level perspective the order doesn't necessarily make much of a problem or is pretty easy to resolve or ignore. Take an update of a task for example, which two distinct entities have sent out as completed. While the applied order could matter internally, the last update wins and thus the history of the model shows two\nupdates that checked the task off. But what matters eventually from the end-user perspective is that the item has been checked off.\nWith this idea in mind, rather than using the regular edit-system matrix already uses for its chat messages, which replaces the entire content with a new content, Acter users distinct Update-Events, with only those fields included that are changed by that update. That unfortunately means that the server can not just calculate the latest version and sent that over the wire, but because the client needs to allow for more precise data-based internal control, wouldn't help much anyways.\nAll data models however, are having this exact idea in mind: it should be okay - for most cases - if just the latest update wins and not too much inner relationship should be assumed to be happening within the same update (as the order of in-between events could render that useless). Be permissive even if that might mean seeing the same event checked off twice, is fine.\nEnd user oriented\nOur models and events are end-user oriented. That sometimes means we encapsulate more UI/UX information than other protocols might want to force on their implementations. We, however, mark everything as development until we have confirmed they work for the end-users in the way we expect them and to ensure consistency and avoid misinterpretation we thus encode all UI/UX information necessary, including what degree they have to be followed.\nFurther more, the event model itself, too, leads from a autonomous-user approach. As an example, to add users to a room, they are only invited rather than hard-added. At the same time, we need to balance that not everything needs the user to first find out about it themselves but instead lead them to good choices to be made. This, too, is ingrained in the modeling of events, their relationship and who can sent them when.\nSpecial Spaces\nBecause Acter needs to read the entire history upon joining to be able to calculate the accurate state of all models in the state machine client side, we do not mix the state machine data with linear chat messages, which reading from the newest backwards is just a fine support case. To signify that a space is of this special state machine, we've set its purpose-state as described in MSC3088 to our special acter purpose value. Only spaces with that purpose state will be read and assumed to be acter spaces with a state machine.\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/docs/architecture/data-model/","title":"Acter Data Model"},"https://dev.acter.global/docs/architecture/repo-layout/":{"body":"The third generation of Acter (\"a3\" or \"A3\") is a matrix-backed community organizing App for the regular joe.

This allows to write template where data can be inserted, replaced, altered but also auto-generated in relation to the user applying it, data they input or the time it is applied. For example, the following would generate a new ActerSpace for the given users, taking their display_name as part of the name and create a todo-list with an action item in it assigned to them:\nversion = \"0.1\"\nname = \"Example Template\"\n\n[inputs]\nmain = { type = \"user\", is-default = true, required = true, description = \"The user\" }\n\n[objects.task_1]\ntype = \"task\"\ntitle = \"Scroll through the news\"\nassignees = [\"{{ main.user_id }}\"]\n\"m.relates_to\" = { event_id = \"{{ start_list.id }}\" }\nutc_due = \"{{ future(mins=5).as_rfc3339 }}\"\n\nTemplate Execution Context\nOther than the overall metadata, each template contains two sections [inputs] and [objects], where as inputs are supplied by the outside executing instance and objects list what should be created. Usually at least one user instance input is required as otherwise no action can be taken, and at least one object should be present, or nothing is to be done.\nBoth inputs and objects are tables, where the key is the name under which the resulting object can be accessed within the template's context afterwards. Especially objects are ordered and will be executed in the order found. As templates might require previously executed data (see the start_list.id in the example above), the templates will also only be executed once the items is reached, no pre-emptive template checking happens before. Neither are type checks of fields being done before the template rendering happened.\nAs all acter events happen by a user, within a space, these must be supplied for most objects or is-default = true must be set on their input or creation. Obviously only one default per type can be specified and if none is specified but needed for the creation of the specific type, the evaluation will abort when reaching that point.\nTemplate Format Reference\nCurrently only version = \"0.1.1\" is supported. This is a first temporary version, used for tests and in the internal formats. Note that versions follow SemVer and everything below 1.0 is considered experimental and its support might be dropped at any time.\nversion\nString. Must be version = \"0.1.1\"\nname\nString.

Just create a new file in the .changes-folder in the root of the repository, ideally prefixed with your PR or issue-number in the file-name for easy collision control, an optional name (with dashes - instead of spaces) and ending with the extension .md. In there, for every significant change create one line starting with a dash and space (- ). Optionally you can add any of [fix], [feature] or[security] first in the line to indicate which type of change that is.\nIf you have additional context you want to provider you can start any additional line explaining the same change with two spaces, aligning it under the first line.

Assuming you are running the docker-compose setup, this would be http://localhost:8118 (which is the fallback default, so you don't have to put it into your environment). Then you can run the integration test with:\nCustom Environment variable under Windows PowerShell\nYou can set up environment variable for cargo as following (assuming the server is accessible at 10.0.0.1:8008 and log level is info):\n$env:DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=\"http://10.0.0.1:8008\"; $env:RUST_LOG=\"info\"; cargo test -p acter-test -- --nocapture\n\n\nCustom Environment variable under Linux Shell\nYou can set up environment variable for cargo as following (assuming the server is available at 10.0.0.1:8008 and log level is warn):\nDEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=\"http://10.0.0.1:8008\" RUST_LOG=\"warn\" cargo test -p acter-test -- --nocapture\n\n\nFlutter UI integration tests\nWe are using convenient_tests framework to build and run flutter integration tests. The default test target is an Android Emulator. You need the above mentioned backend setup\nRunning with the Manager\nYou can easily run the test manager by preparing everything for the target you want to test on (e.g. start the android-emulator, build cargo make android-dev) and then start the test-server and test-manager app by running cargo make ui-tester. While leaving this open, in a second terminal start the app in ui test mode via cargo make ui-test-app (or cargo make ui-test-app-android-emulator for the android-emulator version). You can now reconnect from the manager UI and run the specific tests\nAlternatives\n\nRunning them manually without cargo-make\nRequirements:\n\nTo run the rust integration tests, you need a fresh integration testing infrastructure (see above) available at $DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL with the $DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME set.\nHave your test target ready: build the latest rust-sdk for it (e.g. cargo make android-dev), and have the emulator up and running\n\nTo the run the tests from the interactive manager UI, you can start both the test-server and the manager by running cargo make ui-tester from the repo root (or manually run the cd util/conv_test_man &amp;&amp; flutter run (-d linux / -d macos / -d windows for whichever is your desktop host), then from the app folder run the integration test version of the app by running:\n    flutter run integration_test/main_test.dart --host-vmservice-port 9753 --disable-service-auth-codes --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_APP_CODE_DIR=lib --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=$DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME=$DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME\n\nif you are running it with the Android emulator and have the server exposed on 8118 on your localhost, you need point the urls to 10.0.2.2 and also expose the CONVENIENT_TEST_MANAGER_HOST\nIP as follows:\n    flutter run integration_test/main_test.dart --host-vmservice-port 9753 --disable-service-auth-codes --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_APP_CODE_DIR=lib --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_MANAGER_HOST=10.0.2.2 --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=http:/10.0.2.2:8118/ --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME=localhost\n\nOnce the app is up and ready click \"reconnect\" in the manager and then you can select the tests you want to run.\n\n\nRunning from the entire suite from cli\nRequirements:\n\nTo run the rust integration tests, you need a fresh integration testing infrastructure (see above) available at $DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL with the $DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME set.\nHave your test target ready: build the latest rust-sdk for it (e.g. cargo make android-dev), and have the emulator up and running\n\nFrom the app folder run the integration test version of the app by running:\n    flutter run integration_test/main_test.dart --host-vmservice-port 9753 --disable-service-auth-codes --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_APP_CODE_DIR=lib --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=$DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME=$DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME\n\nif you are running it with the Android emulator and have the server exposed on 8118 on your localhost, you need point the urls to 10.0.2.2 and also expose the CONVENIENT_TEST_MANAGER_HOST IP as follows:\n    flutter run integration_test/main_test.dart --host-vmservice-port 9753 --disable-service-auth-codes --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_APP_CODE_DIR=lib --dart-define CONVENIENT_TEST_MANAGER_HOST=10.0.2.2 --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_URL=http:/10.0.2.2:8118/ --dart-define DEFAULT_HOMESERVER_NAME=localhost\n\nOnce ready, start the automatic full cli-runner by running (from /app):\ndart run convenient_test_manager_dart --enable-report-saver\n\nThat will create a folder with the entire report in your $TMPFOLDER/ConvenientTest/\n\nFrom Visual Studio Code\nIf you have the Flutter extension for vscode you can also run the Run Integration Tests (acter) launch commend from within your VSCode to run the tests directly or use the Run Local Integration Tests on the specific test from within your editor. To debug an integration tests, use the Debug Integration Tests (acter) on the specific test from within the editor - which allows you to add breakpoints and debugging widgets as usual:\n\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/docs/dev/testing/","title":"Testing"},"https://dev.acter.global/docs/dev/troubleshooting/":{"body":"Common problem when developing Acter and their solutions.\n`Unhandled Exception: failed to read or write to the crypto store the account in the store doesn't match the account in the constructor: expected ..:acter.global:guest_device, got ..:acter.global:guest_device\nThe App didn't successfully store the old token and when trying to start a fresh guest account, opening the crypto store failed. Until #527 is fixed, you need to:\n\nstop the app\nclear the user data\nstart the app again\n\nThis should give you a fresh guest account login.\nWhere is the user data stored?\nWe are using path_provider's getApplicationDirectory to know where to store the user data. The exact folder the data is stored, is system dependent.

While new features are being developed they are often made available to the wider audience as \"lab experiments\". Depending their maturity lab experiments can either be activated or deactivated. Once features are stable they are moved out of the labs into their own feature section to configure it to your needs.\nLabs features are experimental and potentially immature ideas, features or concepts. We appreciate you wanting to check them out. Please provide feedback you have about these in the Feedback &amp; Bugs Group Chat.\nHow to enable Labs\nYou can find the Labs under your Settings -&gt; Labs-Section. There you can enable and disable features that are still in heavy development. Please note that default-off labs are often times immature and could cause instability in the app. Caution: Only enable labs if you know what you are doing and are willing to take the risk associated (see below).\nCurrent Labs:\nPush Notifications for mobile\nRisk: low\nDefault: off\nWe now offer mobile Push Notifications for DMs and Group Chats for Android and iOS. Upon activating this feature you will receive push notifications to your Android or iOS device. Upon click on the notifications the App should bring you to the right (chat) screen. Note that\n\nyou must activate this for every device you want to receive push notifications on\nit is only available to iOS and Android at the moment\nyou must restart the app after activating for it to take effect\n\nApps: Events\nRisk: low\nDefault: on\nCalendar events are a default-on app feature in the process of bug-fixing and increased maturity. It allows you to create Events in Spaces, like meetings, calls or any other calendar-like object, that other space members can rsvp to.\nApps: Tasks\nRisk: moderate\nDefault: off\nThis experimental feature allows you to create Task-List and associated Tasks per Space you can manage together. This is an early developer preview which still misses screens and is like to change in design and feature-expanse.\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/app/labs/","title":"Labs"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/app/security/":{"body":"End-2-End Encrypted Chat\nBy default all Chats created with Acter are end-to-end-encrypted. That means only the participants of the chat can decrypted and read the messages. No server, routing proxy or entity that can intercept the message can do anything with them. This applies to Direct Messages as well as Group Chats created with the Acter App.\nMetadata\nAll events contain certain routing metadata required to allow the federated servers to give them to the right target. This includes the senderId (your @userName:server.tld) and the chat or space it belongs to (roomId) even in an encrypted message. Further more, all room state, like avatar, title and list of participants is visible for all participating servers.\nPush Notifications\nPush Notifications in the Matrix context only contain the local session-id, room-id and event-id. Out of that the client fetches the information and decrypts it if necessary for displaying. No relevant information is shared with Apple or Google.\nEncrypted-at-rest storage\nSince the merge of PR 945 (October 2023) all newly created sessions are encrypted-at-rest. That means we are storing all data locally in an encrypted fashion with a locally created, random encryption key that is stored in the operation systems secure enclave (also referred to as \"keychain\"). Even if your device is stolen or taken off you or its data copied, no one will be able to read messages and data received off of that data log unless you unlocked your device.\nDevice verification\nWhen you log in with Acter, as well as in the Activities-section of Acter itself, you might be prompted about \"unverified sessions\". This is a security measure to ensure only devices you use are logged in and no one else is attempting to spoof your identify and sneak into the system. It is highly recommended you cross-verify all devices of your account whenever you notice this coming up.\nShared decryption secrets across verified devices\nOne important reason to verify devices is that, because encryption keys are only held on the end-devices, a new device is not able to read the history of messages before it logged on (you might know that from WhatsApp or Signal). If you verify that sessions with another device that has the encryption keys, they can share them upon request and thus smooth out the problem of a missing history.\nAre space encrypted?\nAs off now, spaces are not encrypted by default. While the plan is to make that the default, there are some challenges around shared history and ensuring consistency when messages can't be decrypted.\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/app/security/","title":"Security"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/":{"body":"","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/","title":"Getting started"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/cli/":{"body":"In some situations, it might be useful to not start the full UI but use only a subset of the acter feature set. For this acter has a command line interface built in. This is only possible on desktop devices.\nStarting acter from the terminal\nFirst you need to open a terminal. If you don't know how to do this, here are some step-by-step-guides for:\n\nWindows\nMac\nLinux\n\nOnce you have a terminal, you can usually just drag and drop the acter-executable from whatever file explorer you are using into the terminal. It should add the path in the Terminal. On Mac this only shows the path to the package, you need to add /Contents/MacOs/Acter to get to the actual executable. To execute the command press enter. This should start the regular Acter App from the terminal giving you some helpful output that you can mark and copy-paste, for example to attach to issue reports.\nAdditionally, before starting the program by pressing enter, you can add various commands after an additional space ( ), that make acter start in a different way:\nActer commands\nBy default, with no extra arguments given (arguments are separated by a space), acter will just load the regular UI and run the proper client. But given a command after the executable will put it into cli mode and it will attempt to do what you are asking from it.\n--help / help [command]\nYou can always start by just adding --help to your acter command. Even though we try to keep this page accurate and up-to-date, this is always the most accurate information about what your specific acter executable supports. So always check that first. To learn more about the options, flags and features of a particular command listed, use help [command] (where you replace [command] with the specific command in question, for e.g. help info) to get more information.\nAt the time of writing this is the output you'll see:\nflutter: community communication and casual organizing platform\n\nUsage: acter &lt;command&gt; [arguments]\n\nGlobal options:\n-h, --help    Print this usage information.\n\nAvailable commands:\n  backup-and-reset   Backup accounts and sessions and reset the state to fresh and clean\n  info               Local info about your acter\n\nRun \"acter help &lt;command&gt;\" for more information about a command.\n\ninfo\nThis command shows you various information about the app and your local data.\nbackup-and-reset\nIssue this command, if you want to reset your local state. This can be necessary if you can't start the app anymore for unknown reasons. This will create a backup of your session and all internal data (including encryption keys) before resetting.\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/cli/","title":"Command Line Interface"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/nightly/":{"body":"","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/nightly/","title":"Nightly"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/nightly/mac/":{"body":"","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/nightly/mac/","title":"Nightly on MacOS"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/setting-up/":{"body":"Installing Acter\nActer is published on the various app stores on a weekly basis.

But you can just the latest nightly build.\nWindows Microsoft Store\n\n    \n\nApple Desktop App AppStore\nnot yet supported tracking issue here . But you can just the latest nightly build\nLinux Flatpak\n\nLinux stable releases are available via flatpak in our own flatpak repo. Most modern Linux distribution ship with flatpak preinstalled, if not learn how to set it up for you here.\nTo install acter through our own flatpak repo via:\nflatpak install --user https://acterglobal.github.io/a3-flatpak/acter.flatpakref\n\nAnd you can update it later via\nflatpak update global.acter.a3\n\n\nPlatform support\nMobile\nOur current built is expected to work on (and above):\n\nAndroid 5.0* (SDKv21 / \"Lollipop\"), ARM64\niOS 11 ARM64 (no x86 or simulator)\n\nDesktop\nWe currently built for\n\nWindows 10 and 11, Arch: x86_64 (no arm)\nMac OS: 10.14* (Mojave) and above on Intel, version 11 an above on Apple Silicon (M1 &amp; M2)\nLinux: Debian 10-11 64bit, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64bit or alike; 32bit &amp; ARM are not supported at the moment\n\n*Note: While we do built against these older API levels, we generally only test against the latest 2 stable releases of any platform and highly recommend keeping the underlying systems up-to-date with the latest security updates from the vendor. Thus we do not recommend using the lowest possible platforms nor support them, as that is often already past its end-of-live and therefore can't be considered a secure platform to run on anymore. See end of life of Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux Kernel.\n\nInstalling latest nightly\nTo install the nightly latest built, head over to the nightly build section and download the corresponding package for your platform. Once the download finished unpack it and run the Acter executable. Be sure to note the following for your platform:\n\nRunning on MacOS\nMacOS will probably refuse to open the application stating it was downloaded from an unknown Source. To allow it to proceed, close that said dialog, Navigate to your `System Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security` and under the security section you'll find the option to `Run Acter anyways`. Click that to start Acter. And subsequent run should work without it bothering you again. You might have to repeat that process for every new downloaded version though.\n\n\nInstall on iPhone/iOS\nWe are running this in a limited so called Ad-Hoc built at the moment, which requires us to register every iOS device with Apple prior for it to work. In order to be able to do that, you need to navigate to [udid.tech](https://udid.tech/) with your target device(s), follow the process there and sent us over the resulting UDID. Once we have received that we will submit it to apple and the next nightly built after (in general) should be able to work on your device. To install just navigate to the [nightly page](/nightly/) on your device and click `iOS / iPhone` - it should ask you a few security questions but then should be willing to proceed.\nNote: We have a limit number (100) of signatures we can add for the built, so please only register devices you are expecting to use and inform us if you stop using any device, so we can free up that slot.\n\n","id":"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/setting-up/","title":"Setting up"},"https://dev.acter.global/user/getting-started/troubleshooting/":{"body":"It asks me for a (registration) token...?!?\nWe are currently running Acter in a private beta.
